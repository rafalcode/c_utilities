# c\_utilities
Various input/output and system utilities
(note: used to be called "sysaduts" system administration
utilites, but realised they were becomeign more general than that)

# Programs
* matread: reads a text which consists of a raw matrix of arbitrary size. floats assumed all round.
* genread: parses a text file into lines and words.
* dreadi: this is a pretty robust records-set-out-as-paragraphs datafile reader. It assumes that each record starts with
a name (string) and then a series of integers, which can be any number, but of course must be the same for each record.

# TODO
I'd like to deal with filelistings files.
There would have only one word per line.
